## The definition of wealth is "an abundance of valuable possessions or money." - Google referencing Oxford Languages
- My understanding of this definition is that wealth can come in many different forms.
- Social/Love
- Financial/Fiscal (Money)
- Health (Physical/Mental/Emotional)
- Time (freedom)

I'm coming to learn that it's honestly all about a balance of what I value and focusing on my own priorties. The beautiful thing about humanity is that everyone
values each item or whatever item differently. I'm choosing to be financially stable, work towards a wealthy social and love life, work on my overall health, and
allow myself enough time to have responsible impulsive decisions and explore my interests. A royal flush of sorts.
