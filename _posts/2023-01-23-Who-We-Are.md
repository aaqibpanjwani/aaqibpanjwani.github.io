<br>
When I was growing up, the type of self-help, self-identifying, materials I would read would boaster about how we are a cumulation of those we surround ourselves with. 
<br>
'take the good, and leave the bad',
<br>
but what they don't tell us is that even the most mentally tough, most self-assured person can and will lose parts of themselves if they spend enough time
with someone(s). 
<br>
**It's not as simple as take what's good and leave the rest.**
<br>
With enough time spent, the more we agree with someone, or a group of people, we tend to overlook and latch on to things we normally wouldn't agree with.
<br>
**Losing our core-selves in the process**
<br>
As I am getting older and travel further along into my mental health journey, I'm learning that we are a cumulation of the people and places we surround ourselves with.
<br>
<br>
The good and the bad.
<br>
<br>
That is why there is a need and an importance to be placed for self-care and alone time.
<br>
Who we are when we're alone and/or not being influenced is who we truly are, and that is when we can recognize what to work on for ourselves in order to progress. 
<br>
Then practise integrity. Show up as our authentic selves anywhere and everywhere.
<br>
**There is no need to fear ourselves. No need to fear if we are loveable. No need to fear of being alone. The right people will gravitate towards us, they
will stick around, and they will love us for who we truly are and not the facad that we've built up based off of everyone else.**
