## A definition of Life according to Merriam-Webster is "the sequence of physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual."
- My understanding of this definition is that life happens to us, and depending on how we perceive these situations it could be viewed as happening for us.
- There many different views society has about how life should be lived. For some, life should be difficult in all aspects. For others, life should be a smooth ride.
- My personal view is that life can be easy with the right people, growth, love, acceptance, progress, etc. Life does not need to be difficult, there will always be difficulties, but the difficulties can definitely be manageable when we're in the right environment, surrounded by the right people giving the right support.
 
## I personally have made my most exponential growth in a loving, kind, and caring teaching environment.


Digging deeper in to the circumstances life has to offer. I've started to learn that although we, as humans have free will, we can choose
what choices we make, and it will always be circumstantial. We are essentially thrown into an environment and are expected to make the best of our situations
or fail trying. I am a human, I make mistakes, I also learn and grow from them. Life is a journey, and sometimes the path is not clear, but that does not mean
I cannot try to make the best of it and live life in a kind and enjoyable manner. I will trip, I will slip, I will fall, but I will get back up, dust myself off,
and press on.
