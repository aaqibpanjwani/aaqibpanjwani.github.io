We all have a path in life, and most of us use our circumstances as an excuse to not execute any portion of what we really want. 
<br>There are many paths in life someone may choose, and I'm choosing **kindness**<br>
I will stumble.<br> I will slip into old habits.<br> I will fall into letting my anger control me.<br> 
But I will never give up trying to make an amends with myself and those that I have hurt, and continue to keep pushing forward with compassion.
