## From what I've learned and am continuing to learn/implement: Selfcare is the best form of care
- Workout
- Make a meal I really enjoy (breakfast is my go-to to treat my sweet tooth). Chocolate chip protein pancakes (almost) every morning ðŸ˜„
- Watching youtube videos that bring me joy
- Taking care of my overall hygiene (shower, brush teeth, etc)
- Listen to my favorite music playlist
- Read a good book
- Smile
- Laugh
- Play around, be joyful. It definitely makes it easier to do with my pups
- Sometimes just say "fuck it" and do something impulsive, responsibly of course ðŸ˜†
- If absolutely needed, take a break, take a moment, lay down, pause, **and breathe**
