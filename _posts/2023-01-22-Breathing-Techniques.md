title: Breathing Techniques

For when I feel anxious or ungrounded, my go-to breathing technique is to do 3 rounds of this breathwork exercise: 
1. Inhale through my nose until I feel full of air
2. Pause for 1 or 2 seconds
3. Inhale a little more
4. Pause and hold for at least 4 seconds (1 mississippi, 2 mississippi, etc)
5. Exhale as forcefully as possible through my mouth
6. Repeat
