## Just a thought about the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors
- A proper mind dump relating the game of rock, paper, scissors to life. When interacting with someone or building a relationship with someone, we can choose
any of the "roles" we want in the relationship. We can be the rock, firm, sturdy, and solid, if the other person chooses paper we might soften up more than we knew possible.
If we choose to be scissors, and the other person chooses rock, we might just end up loosing some of our "sharpness" or even durability, and so on. But there
might be the possibility of a fourth option, hand. As the role of the hand, we can choose whether or not we would like to play the game, and with a strong sense of self
we then can be more firm in the role(s) we choose in our relationships. 

- But what do I know, just a thought ðŸ˜„
