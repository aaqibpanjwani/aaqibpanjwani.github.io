I'm a mental health advocate that is aiming to share knowledge and resources that have helped me along my journey. Coping mechanisms, insights, wisdoms, strategies, influencers, and texts that have played a role in helping me become a more caring, kind, and compassionate person.

### More Information

I'm just someone that's trying to help. I will be content as long as this helps one person.
