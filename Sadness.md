# Techniques I Use to Help me Break Out of Sad/Low Energy Spells
## It's usually something deeper than "just feeling sad"

### For when I'm feeling like I have absolutely no energy to go on with my day. 
1. Set some time aside to feel it out, MAX 3 hours. (slowly but surely lowering that amount of time)
2. Cuddle the pups
3. Take a nap if needed
4. After the time I set is done 
5. **Suck it up, get up, drink some water, eat some food, take care of my responsibilities, and get moving**
6. Go for a walk, explore nature, or to a park
